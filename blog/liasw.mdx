Heyo,

I hope your year is off to a fantastic start.

I wanted to let you know that I've added a new [lyrics tab](https://music.johnnyrwest.com/lyrics) to my website. I will be keeping it updated with new all releases as they come.

I also wanted to announce my next song, "Love Is a Servant's Word", which will be released on February 14th. It's a song about the sacrifices we make for love. Sometimes that can be a very trying thing to have to do.

I've had the song around for a while and have had the opportunity to play it for folks throughout the years. Their feedback alone has encouraged me to commit to it and finally record it. I'm excited to share it with you.

Spotify/Apple music pre-save is available [here](https://music.johnnyrwest.com/links/liasw?hypesource=blog).

As always, thank you for listening.

Until next time,

\- J
