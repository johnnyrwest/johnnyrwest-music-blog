Heyo,

I hope you are all doing well this holiday season!

I am enjoying the California sweater weather, wrapping gifts, and getting our favorite movies in before the year is over.

Looking back at 2023, I have a lot to celebrate. I finally launched my solo music project and released my first single, "I'm Still Here". The response has been awesome, and I really appreciate reconnecting with all the old friends who reached out, as well as making new ones (thank you social media!).

To wrap up the year, I am announcing my next single, "Desire", which will be releasing on January 5th, 2024. It's a nice contrast to "I'm Still Here" in terms of the subject and overall sound â€” I'm excited to share it with you all. 

Spotify/Apple music pre-save is available [here](https://music.johnnyrwest.com/links/desire).

Thank you for listening and supporting my music. I hope you have a wonderful holiday season and a happy new year!

Talk to you in 2024,

\- J
