Heyo,

Long time no chat! I hope you are all doing well.

I'm excited to announce that my full-length album, "Waking Up", will be coming out on July 31st! It's been in the works for quite some time, so I'm excited for it to finally see the light of day.

The album is a reflection on my journey through some dark years, and it's the result of a lot of hard work and introspection. I put the album together myself, piece by piece, while going through a few major life changes. I learned a lot about myself and music during this time.

In any case, it's a dream come true to be able to share it with you all.

For those of you looking to purchase it, I'll be taking pre-orders for the album [here](https://johnnyrwest.bandcamp.com/album/waking-up). If you choose to pre-order, you will receive a digital download of the album on July 31st along with some other digital goodies.

I also have t-shirts available for order that features artwork by my partner Maddy. Those are ready to ship out today, and you can check them out [here](https://johnnyrwest.bandcamp.com/merch/coyote-t-shirt-2).

Finally, I will be hosting a listening party on July 25th at 7:30p PST, playing the entire album ahead of its release. The link to RSVP to that is [here](https://johnnyrwest.bandcamp.com/merch/waking-up-listening-party) and I will have more details on a live stream soon.

Thanks for sticking with me through all of this. I can't wait for you to hear Waking Up in its entirety.

Be back with more updates soon,

\- J
