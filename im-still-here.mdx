Heyo!

Long time no talk.

I have a new single coming out on November 21st called "I'm Still Here".

It's a Thanksgiving song of sorts, as I am glad to be alive and well despite some of my worst days.

I've been learning to be nicer to myself, and I hope you are too.

Spotify pre-save is available [here](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/johnnywest/im-still-here).

I'll be back with more updates soon.

Thanks,

\- J
