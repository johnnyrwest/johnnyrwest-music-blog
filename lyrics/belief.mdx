I didn't want you to see\
I didn't want you to recognize me\
Until I made myself to be\
Everything that I want to be

Patience is wearing thin\
I've got thicker skin, but it's tiring\
And I've been chased around by\
Evil thoughts inside my head

So be in\
Or be out\
But there is no second guessing

And I know\
That I'm tired\
But I want\
To keep the story going

Oh

How many mountains will you climb\
How high will you fly\
Just how far will you go?

Is that something that we ever know?

I'll follow\
Follow, to the end of the road

Well I could live my whole life\
I could live my whole life\
Not knowing what's ahead\
Not knowing what's behind

I'm a victim of my own thoughts\
I'm evicted by my own love

Hard times are just getting worse\
Your life is under the curse of your belief\
And you could have it all but\
You choose to run away from love

I'll give a hundred percent\
And even that's not a guarantee, you know\
But I could sleep my best in\
Knowing that I gave it all

So be in\
Or be out\
But there is no second guessing

And I know\
That I'm tired\
But I want to keep that fire growing\
Bold\
And beautiful

Iâ€™m calling out\
I'll do whatever it takes\
I'll even change my ways\
Oh
