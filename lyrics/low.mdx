I hold my own\
Down at the bottom of the ocean\
I'm tired

I want it back\
The life that I had\
The one where I didn't question why

And how does it feel\
When your friends are older\
When your life is over\
Before it starts?

So stay back my man\
It's part of the plan\
Don't get caught in the crosshairs\
Of my life

I stay low\
I stay low\
I stay low

I'm lost\
Alone\
No place to call home and I'm\
One slip away from nothing

I wait for love\
Will it ever show up\
Making something out of nothing's tough

So don't hold your tongue\
I've been out on my own\
Having nothing to hold\
Or hold on to

And I go my own way\
Yeah, I make my own fate\
I live a life that's not just here\
On the surface

I stay low\
I stay low\
I stay low

I stay low\
I stay low\
I stay low

I'm lost\
Alone\
No place to call home but I\
I'll make it through the long nights
