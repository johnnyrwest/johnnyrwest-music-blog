Close your eyes\
And breathe in deep\
And count to ten\
Cause it's alright

Well, I've been around\
And I've been worn down\
And I've still got love\
If no one else does

How does it feel\
To live in a dream\
With your feet on the ground\
Pointed backward?

I wanna break free\
From what holds me down\
It's not an excuse\
It's my life

I've seen love\
And I've seen hate\
I've seen beauty\
I've seen shame

I've had dreams\
And tried the same\
I've been turned down\
And pushed away

Still I choose love\
And where do we go?\
Is that enough\
And where do we go?

Cause I've seen pain\
And where do we go?\
And I've been afraid\
And where do we go?

You can live your whole life underground\
You can live your whole life underground\
You can live your whole life underground\
You can live your whole life underground
