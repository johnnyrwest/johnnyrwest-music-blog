It's the bed that's made up at the homeowner's cost\
It's a medicine cabinet, with secrets untouched\
It's a wartime story that you've never heard\
And love is a servant's word

It's the hand that goes missing when you're paying the rent\
It's the gun that you keep in your glove compartment\
It's a sunrise with no sleep and you're up with the birds\
And love is a servant's word

Well I saw you crying\
Just as I tore myself in two\
And God knows I'm trying\
But love is a servant's word

It's the songs that we lost when you drowned in the pool\
Your heart was so far gone that your body couldn't move\
There was something inside, man the lines just got blurred\
When love was a servant's word

Well I saw you crying\
Just as I tore myself in two\
But God knows I'm trying\
And love is a servant's word
