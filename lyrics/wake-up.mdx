Daylight comes and startles us\
Hasty breakfast, commuter bus\
Plug away the hours of the day

It’s sunny out but I feel cold\
Something about this is getting old\
It’s leaving me with nothing left to say

How a man with friends\
And a pretty good job\
Can feel so much like giving up\
Doesn’t even cross my mind, you know

But lately I’ve been wondering\
If all this life is worth living\
Is there anything I have to show?

Oh, and I’m so tired\
Of feeling stuck\
Oh, and I don’t want to\
Ever wake up

Well it’s touchscreen phones\
Designer jeans\
I still don’t know yet what it means\
To be content with myself for day

But if I’ve learned anything before\
It’s best to keep from getting bored\
I try to keep those demons far away

Oh, and I’m so lonely\
I’m terrified\
Oh, I’m only happy\
In dreams at night

Oh, and I’m so tired\
Of feeling stuck\
Oh, and I don’t want to\
Ever wake up
