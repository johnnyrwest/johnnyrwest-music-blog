I think about it a couple times a year\
But I'm still here, you know\
I think about my family and what they'd say to that\
But I'm still here, you know\

I'm still here\
I'm still here, you know\
I'm still here\
I'm still here, you know\

I'm making peace with love and what it means to live\
And I'm still here, you know\
I'll find redemption as I'm learning to forgive\
And I'm still here, you know\

I'm still here\
I'm still here, you know\
I'm still here\
I'm still here, you know\
