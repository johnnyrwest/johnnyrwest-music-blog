I see red\
Coming down the aisles\
Of all you made me\
I never forgave you for that

And I feel it\
Another automation\
Of your creation\
Where everything is my fault

Something in the way you are\
That's golden\
Something in the way you are\
That's goldâ€¦

What the hell\
You couldn't keep it quiet\
With all this riot\
Still everyone is to blame

Something in the way you are\
That's golden\
Something in the way you are

And I don't care\
Take it when it's given\
In holy silence\
We'll end this running around

Something in the way you are\
That's golden\
Something in the way you are\
That's golden\
Something in the way you are\
That's golden\
Something in the way you are
