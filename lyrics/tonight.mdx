Well I gave away my only name\
And I sang your praises all in vain\
From what we had and where we go\
There's many winding paths and roads

Tonight\
Tonight\
Tonight\
Tonight

And don't you wish that it were all so simple\
Yeah don't you wish that you could feel it in your own soul?\
I think I found a way of cleaning out my own heart\
I'll take a second look and\
I'll feel it all

Tonight\
Tonight\
Tonight

Just give me love, no lies\
I'll be your friend this time\
Just give me autumn nights\
And I'll be by your side
