I hear it coming in the sound of the rain
The fire's growing and it's calling my name
I lean in closer and see what it's about
I feel desire, but it's not what I want

Holy hell, you hold your head up high
Even when the fire rages
And oh my god it would have brought me to my knees
But you're calm and cool, courageous

Try to control it but you can't keep it down
With all the dreams you had still hanging around
You start a fire in a place of your own
And give up everything for your chance to know

Holy hell, you hold your head up high
Even when the fire rages
And oh my god it would have brought me to my knees
But you're calm and cool, courageous

And oh
And oh

I see it coming
I see it coming
I see it coming
I see it coming

Holy hell, you hold your head up high
Even when the fire rages
And oh my god it would have brought me to my knees
But you're calm and cool, courageous

And oh
And oh
